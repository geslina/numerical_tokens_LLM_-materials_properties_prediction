# numerical_tokens_LLM_-materials_properties_prediction
Code used to generate results for the study "Materials properties predictions: the role of numerical tokens in Large Language Models." Author: Alexis Geslin

This study was inspired by the work by Rubungo et al. (arXiv:2310.14029). Llm-prop: Predicting physical and electronic properties of crystalline solids from their text descriptions, ArXiv 2023.

Part of the code is adapted from their repository.
